# In-the-Loop

## What's this about ##
* This is a collection of links, blogs, books, people and more in the fields of Deep learning, Computer Vision, and Self-Driving cars. I came across all this information in the past month due to my heightened interest in these fields. I will keep updating this whenever I find something useful. Suggestions and criticisms to organize this information for better productive processing are most welcome.
